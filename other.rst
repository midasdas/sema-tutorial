SEMA Presenter
--------------

SEMA Presenter is a lightweight version of SEMA Experience that can be used to show off projects to your customers. It doesn't require a dongle, and therefore is much faster to start up. Users without a licence can also install it.

Basic features such as measuring tools are available in Presenter, but projects can not be modified.

For a project to work in Presenter it needs to have *Presenter* status, which can be enabled in *BP properties*. However, for this option to be available, the *SEMA Presenter* module must be installed.
