About This Tutorial
===================

Welcome to this SEMA tutorial.

The reasons why I wrote this tutorial is because the support for the SEMA software is very limited. Besides that, the help files that come with the software are usually written in poor English and are mostly outdated.

Keep in mind that everything in this manual is written by me, so everything is based on my own experiences. Therefore, if you find wrong or incomplete information, please email me. You can also send me entirely new content, which after reviewing, I will add to this manual.

This is not an official manual, and is not associated with SEMA in any way.

Sincerely,

Midas
